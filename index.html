        TRAVEL TO THE WORLD 
    </h1>
    <p>
        Before planning a trip, we tend to do a lot of research on both Google and social media. Therefore, the demand for reading other people's travel reviews is high. If you’re a globetrotter, consider this type of outlet. You can start with an insider’s guide on places to explore near you, offering reasons to visit your very own hometown, region or country.

            We recommend honing in on a travel niche, whether it’s a type of hotel (luxury hotels, hostels, etc.), a kind of trip (backpacking, camping, etc.) or a geographical area. For instance, the blogger behind Tales Of Israel shares inspiring guides focusing only on the Holy Land. This makes her an expert and a trustworthy source to readers.

            Dave Grohl said, "No one is you, and that is your power." It’s true that almost all corners of the world have been written about, but they have not been written about by you. People will experience your destinations through your eyes. Help them get to know you and the reasons you like traveling with an intriguing About Me page.
